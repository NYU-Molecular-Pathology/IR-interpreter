CCDC6 - RET	Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma			fusion	RET is a receptor tyrosine kinase that binds ligands of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family and transmits intracellular signals via the pro-oncogenic mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. RET is normally expressed in the developing embryo, playing a particularly important role in neural and neuroendocrine lineages. In cancer, RET can be activated either through point mutations or gene rearrangements with a variety of translocation partners resulting in constitutively active cytosolic oncoproteins. Heritable activating mutations in RET lead to the highly penetrant familial cancer syndromes multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A: medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, hyperparathyroidism), multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B (MEN2B: medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, multiple mucosal neuromas and intestinal ganglioneuromas, marfanoid habitus) and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC). Oncogenic somatic mutations include point mutations and genomic rearrangements of the RET locus leading to inversions or translocations. These have been identified in various cancers including papillary thyroid cancer, lung adenocarcinoma and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). In addition, aberrant expression or activation of wildtype RET correlates with tumor invasion and metastasis in pancreatic cancer and endocrine therapy resistance in breast cancer.	Mulligan LM.

FGFR3 - TACC3				fusion	Oncogenic gene fusion involving the tyrosine kinase domain of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) and transforming acidic coiled-coil 3 (TACC3) is formed as a result of a 70 kb tandem duplication on chromosome 4p16.3. FGFR3-ATCC3 fusion has been reported in up to 8.3% of glioblastomas. FGFR fusions have been shown to activate MAPK signaling pathway by constitutive receptor dimerization and kinase activity. The fusion protein localizes to mitotic spindle poles and induces mitotic and chromosomal segregation defects and triggers aneuploidy. Preclinical studies have shown that FGFR inhibitor prolongs survival in mice with fusion-initiated glioma. Clinical trials with FGFR inhibitors are ongoing for patients with recurrent glial neoplasms.	Xu T, et al.

CDK4	Glioblastoma			other	CDK4/6 are cyclin dependent kinases, important for cell cycle progression. CDK4 gene amplification has been observed in 15% of malignant gliomas and dysregulation of the CDK4/6-Rb-E2F cell cycle-axis occurs in about 80% of GBMs. CDK4/6 amplification is known to be associated with a poor patient prognosis in GBM. In vitro and vivo studies have shown that combining CDK 4/6 and mTOR inhibition has synergistic effects against glioblastoma stem cell lines.	Furgason JM, et al.
